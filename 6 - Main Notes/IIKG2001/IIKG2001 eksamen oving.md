SAMM is an openframework made by OWASP. it helps 
governece, desgin, implementations, verificaition, operation


*non repudidation* prevents denabiites of actions
- a party cannot deny the authenticity of their actions


residual risk, remains after the implementations of countermeasures and safeguards


risk handling methodes:
risk mitigation - reduce the impact of a risk
risk avoidance - eliminite risk by avoiding risk activities
risk transfer - shift risk to another party
risk accpetance - take no actions when risk takes place
risk deterrence - dicourage malicios activities

least priivilage - a user should have least amount of privilage
least comman mechanism - system components should not share mechaism
complete mediation - every access request to a system

audits logs - detailed records that documents events actions or transactions. gives information. it wont do anything


CAPTCHA
CSRF - cross site requrest forgery
makes a challange for user
makes user interact
verify if response is correct


parity bit checking mechanism can be used 
- i sused for detecting errors in data transmissions
- *cant be* used for input validation




non repudiation - it prevents deniabilitiey of actions

Use case modeling - clarify requirements with business users

forward tracing - 

steganography is the practice of concealing inforamtion within another  medium.

Cryptograhic agility - app is designed to allow for easliy swapping the cryptographic algorithms

GDPR right to be informed is for lawfullness

policy decomposition - breaking down high level policies

thread modeling - used for identifying and mitigate potential security threats and vulnerabilities

subject object modeling - used in access control and security system. finding realtionship between subject and object

Defense in Depth - multiple layers of secuirty controls
Economy of Mechanism - keeps the design and implementation of security mechanisms as simple and minimal as possible

primary reasing for a man in the middle attack is: i*mproper session managment.*

software development life cycle
thread modeling us initated in design phase

the process of removing privare information from sensitive data sets
- ANONYMIZATION

Protection need elicitation
- first step is to engage the customer


steganography - concealing a secret message or data within another mdeium


certificare authority, authority, registration authority an dcertificat, 
- public key infrastructure PKI

THe use of digital signature has the benefit of providing. non repudiation

the amount of time which the busniess oeration need to restore to service levels as expected. 
- *recovery time objective*

single sign on primary reason
- it helps improve the user experience
- simplifies the user authentication



Address space layout randomiation - makes it difficult for an attacker to guess the memory address


countermeasures and safeguards. protection and provention

during threat modeling. is review to identity entry points

checksum validation - this ensures data *integrity* by comparing checksum values


improper memory calls and infinte loop - availability

man in the middle is *spoofing*

*seperation of duties* no single, no single individual has complete control over cirtical task or processes
- it is spread


data classification is a core activity in inforamtion life cycle

target of evaluation

*Secure sockets layer* secure communication over internet
- help mitigate hijcaking andreplay attacks in alocal area

availability requirments are used to protect against the destruction of information or the software itself

code signing - adding a digital signature to a software
- runtime permission for code

on error resume next breaks with *fail secure*

Service level agreements
- contract between service provider and a client. outlines the specific terms and contidions

ITU x509 is the digital certificate 


three common assumptions made aboout sessions:
- communications within the sessions is secure
- no other entites than authentication ones are active
- the client is authenticated


good modular programming:
- loosely coupled
- high cohesion



Extended validation certificates
- mitm attacks
- phisiing attacks


where should input validation be performed
- can validate both client and the server


for protecting data. should use salting for password
- use salting for passwords
- protect backups and logs
- avoid hard coding secrest in code


multifactor authenications is most effective against MITM


*DFD* - data flow diagram (attack surface is not part of this)
data store
external entity
trust boundary
data flow
process


data protection officer
- helpes cooperations with authorities
- helpes with implementing privacy by design
- monitors the controller for complinece
- advises the controller on privacy aspect


virus and worm are the only *proliferaive types*

symmetric key crupto - good for speed and large volume of data

code signing can provide (it is NOT authentication of users)
- runtime permission for code
- authenticity of code origin
- anti-tampering protection
