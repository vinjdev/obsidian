# # Sustainability
challanges:
- mismatch in lifespan
	ICT rarly last as
- security-dependability gap
	- safty system threats accidents, and secutirty system deals with attackers
- unforseeable threats:

Main objectives:
- avoid system failures
- minimize overheads

Solutions:
- subsystem isolation
- replication and diversification
- mulitple lines of defense
- long term confidentiality
- adaption

in incorporating security improvement would cost.

is it worth it?
![[Pasted image 20241021124630.png]]
yes
better energy use.

makes the system more efficient

better use of resources

for societal benefits.
protecting sensitive information


sustanability is about long term thinking
privcy by design.
patching is more short term

securuty by design. is the way to go for a sustainable software


ideas

sufficient
algortihms

open source vs closed sourced
- software as a digital resource
