## regression analysis
relationship between *dependent* variable and one or more *independent variables*

we find out which variables have impact on output
we find what factors matters the most

## coreelation vs regression

coreelation
finds mutual relatinship bewteen variables

predicts dependent value based at least one independent variable
![[Pasted image 20250120183246.png]]
coreelation is not effect

regression
key attributes
![[Pasted image 20250120183400.png]]
independent variables (input ) and the dependent variables output

how can we predict values with this??

different relationships
linear vs curves

## univariate regression or simple linear regression
![[Pasted image 20250120183650.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250120183702.png]]
this is the parameters
called *model parameters coefficients*
Bo is the avarage value of Y when X is 0

## exmample
houseing
![[Pasted image 20250120183840.png]]

Y the depent value 
X the squere meters (used to estimate price)

![[Pasted image 20250120183924.png]]
the total sum and the regression sum

![[Pasted image 20250120183945.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250120184004.png]]
this is the average value of the dependt value

Yi is th real value from the REAL data

![[Pasted image 20250120184041.png]]
this is the predicted value from every xi

#### coefficient of determination (rÂ²)
