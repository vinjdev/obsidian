*Intelligence
power of perceptions learning and understanding and knowing*

Artifical inteligence
- algorithms - learns and takes a plausible decision based on input

IMPORTANT POINTS IN AI
- LEARNING
- UNDERSTANDING PATTERNS
- JUDGMENT / DECISION MAKING
- PERCEPTION - become aware

#### machine learning
![[Pasted image 20250115143741.png]]
a field f study where computers can learn without being exlicitly programmed

Example driving

*task* - driving on E6
*performance* - average distance before a humans finds poor driving decisions
*experience* - a sequence of images and steering commands recoreded of a human driver

performance er noe som kan m√•les

### AI VS ML VS DL

ai mimics humans
ml learns without being programmed
dl extract patterns from data using neural network

## machine learning
pipeline
![[Pasted image 20250115145330.png]]
dataframe
transformer
esitmator
evaluator

There are two groups of machine learning
supervised learning
unsupervised 

![[Pasted image 20250115145534.png]]
supervised predict output from input
unsupervised looks for pattterns or clusters in data

other learning paradigm
![[Pasted image 20250115150104.png]]


supervised learning is to map input variables X to the output variables Y

unsupervised performance is worse than supervised

semisupervised tries to balance
![[Pasted image 20250115151920.png]]
some labeled and some unlabeled data

## probability
laws of chance
![[Pasted image 20250115152337.png]]

## conditioning
![[Pasted image 20250115152415.png]]
we have more than two possible outcomes. so chain it toghether
![[Pasted image 20250115152503.png]]

## marginalization
summing or integraing out one or more random variables to obtian the probility and distrbution of other vairbles of intrest

![[Pasted image 20250115152847.png]]

## Bayes rule
it gives the reverse probaility
by using condition and marginalization
![[Pasted image 20250115153020.png]]

## classifaiction and regression
classification, the output is discrete
in regression, continous output is obtained

classification is how the algorithm can seperate the daata from each other
![[Pasted image 20250115153412.png]]

linear regression makes an ansumptions from input and creates a function with X and Y
