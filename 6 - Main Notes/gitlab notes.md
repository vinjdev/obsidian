- Make a fork of the course project.
    - You can do that by clicking `Fork` button on the upper right corner of the main project page.
    - Fork it into your workspace of `prog2006` or into your personal workspace on Gitlab.
    - Clone the forked repo to your computer.
- Edit the `quotes.md` file by adding a quote that you like and want to share. Leave space between your quote and other quotes.
- Do not edit ANY other file in the repository. Do not add any new files either.
- Create a pull request to the original repository from your fork. You can do that by clicking "Create Merge Request" button next to the commit with your change in your forked project.
- Wait for the pull request to be reviewed and accepted. Check the status of the pull request to see if it was accepted or if you need to make changes.
- Enjoy the feeling of contributing to a project and sharing a quote that you like.
